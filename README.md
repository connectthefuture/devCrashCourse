 A Crash Course Introduction into the world of Agile Software Development for people with a sparse or non-existent background in Software Development.

 I held this presentation as a Brownbag session at ThoughtWorks Hamburg. The TDD part included a live coding session and the part about Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery was backed with an example of a real Continuous Integration Server that worked on the results from the TDD live
 coding session.
